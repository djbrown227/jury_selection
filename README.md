**Project Title:** Jury Selection Assistance Tool

**Summary:**

Developed a machine learning-based tool to assist legal professionals in jury selection. The tool utilizes supervised learning models, including Random Forest and Logistic Regression, to predict jurors' likelihood of favoring prosecution based on factors such as prior convictions and neighborhood crime rates. An ensemble model combining these two classifiers was also implemented for improved performance.

**Key Features:**

- Utilized Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.
- Implemented a simulation process to demonstrate the tool's usage in a jury selection scenario.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of the tool through accuracy metrics and simulated jury selection outcomes.

**Impact:**

- Provides legal professionals with a data-driven approach to jury selection, potentially reducing bias and improving trial outcomes.
- Demonstrates the application of machine learning in the legal domain, highlighting its potential to augment decision-making processes.

**Future Enhancements:**

- Integration of additional features and data sources to improve model performance.
- Exploration of advanced machine learning techniques, such as NLP, for deeper juror analysis.
- Collaboration with legal experts to refine the tool and ensure compliance with legal standards and ethics.
